<p style="text-align:center;">Each trading day thousands of comments are posted by traders at all experience and capital levels. Each
  twenty-four hour cycle yields a novel-length collection of threads,
  non-sequiturs and mixed-media posts. Some material appears more toward an airing of grievances. And, some may or may not
  give a glimpse into meaningful clusters of informally-organised trade activity. <br><br>
