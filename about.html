<h4 style="text-align:center;">about this site</h4>
<div class="ex2"><p>Hosted on GitHub Pages, The Errant Analyst website is home to chart visualisation output from a Python program written by H. Leonard-Sullivan. The program is designed to convert
social-financial chat collected from Reddit into sentiment data sets which have the potenital to describe log-return divergence from benchmark ETFs. (Please read the Terms of Service <a href="tos.html">ToS</a>).<br><br>
This endeavour began as a final project for the Data Science part-time remote course offered by General Assembly.
Unlike financial journalism, analyst recommendation reports, company earnings call transcripts, and other
more deliberative sources, social commentary may or may not yield informally-organised ideation.
At present, it is difficult to dismiss parallels to the late-1990s tech backdrop. Aside from lofty
valuations and instead of the supposed apocalyptic potential of Y2k, limitations associated with the pandemic
are increasing usage and urging upgrades in technology. Zero-commission web apps have reimagined CNBC's
streaming of financial happenings alongside broker advertisements into every living room, hair-dressers
shop and the like. That said, recent changes in participation may be a demonstration of changing attitudes toward
market orthodoxy by Millenials and Gen Z participants, having the potential to challenge longstanding
acceptance of qualitative, quantitative, and quantamental investment approaches.<br><br>
The excitement of this project lies in documenting the chatter and exploring the ways with which the
data may be used to enhance our understanding of this particular group of market participants. After
pre-processing (cleaning), natural language processing techniques are used to score sentiment/subjectivity and
surface a subset of posts containing an elevated use of terms related to trade ideas.<br><br>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">data analytics</h4>
Comments are collected twice daily through the Reddit API. Pre-processing covers duplicates, bot
commentary, daily summary and an application of regex to improve identification of ticker
mentions and performance of machine learning libraries. NLTK, Textblob and Spacy are used to process
stop words, tokenise, lemmatise and generate sentiment and subjectivity scoring. Vectorisation of comments
occurs via TF-IDF. Thus far clustering and dimension reduction have been most successful at three
clusters when subjectivity is not considered.<br><br>Stock prices are collected at the close through Yahoo
via datareader. Log returns are generated locally using Python. Linear regression with polynomial features
and associated metrics are generated with the scikit-learn library functionality. R-squared has been
chosen as the baseline metric, given its wide use by both qualitative and quantitative styled
managers. Regression metrics for a given company/benchmark pair are offered as a baseline, all-sentiment
and clustered-sentiment metrics in a rolling time-series format. Images are produced in Python via matplotlib and seaborn.</p></div>
