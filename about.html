<div class="ex2"><p>The Errant Analyst is home to independent work produced by Heather Leonard-Sullivan. Hosted
on GitHub Pages, the static site makes available tabular and visualisations from the daily processing of
social-financial chat collected from Reddit. The objective is two-fold: 1- to compile, process and deliver a
quantitative view of the novel-length comment body posted to the site each day and over time, and 2- (given
that my job was eliminated in April 2020) to provide a platform to demonstrate data analysis work created
using python and machine learning techniques.<br><br>
This endeavour began as a final project for the Data Science part-time course offered by General Assembly. To
provide an accounting to potential users, ticker frequency and vocabulary lists have been added as views for
each listed ticker. Work continues on the application of natural language processing techniques thereon. Unlike
financial journalism, analyst recommendation reports, company earnings call transcripts, and other more
deliberative sources, social commentary may or may not yield informally-organised ideation. The entertainment
quality of its spontaneity and the coin/creddit system that assigns rewards available on the site are based
on popular support for posts that resonate with subreddit members. Additionally, similar to shouting at a
large party, comments may be simply a reflection of price action or what someone heard or they may express
views that are detached from or run counter to the post user's actual trade activity.<br>It is difficult to
dismiss parallels to the late-1990s tech boom for the present day. Aside from lofty valuations and instead
of the supposed apocalyptic potential of Y2k, limitations associated with the pandemic are increasing usage
and urging upgrades in technology. Zero-commission web apps have reimagined CNBC's streaming of financial
happenings alongside broker advertisements into every living room, hair-dressers shop and the like. And, it
appears at the time of this writing that endless coverage of the ballot recounts in Bush v Gore may get
revisited. Whether the recent overtaking of price action on specific tickers related to retail trading is
for the moment, for so long as there is fiscal stimulus, for so long as rates live near zero-bound, or has
the potential to challenge the qualitative-quantitative-quantamental classification matrix is the excitement
in documenting the chatter and exploring the ways with which the data may be used to enhance our
understanding of this particular group of market participants.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">>Data Analytic</span><br>
Comments are collected twice daily through the Reddit API. Pre-processing covers duplicates, bot
commentary, daily summary and an extensive application of regex to improve identification of ticker
mentions and performance of machine learning libraries. NLTK, Textblob and Spacy are used to process
stop words, tokenise, lemmatise and generate sentiment and subjectivity scoring. Vectorisation of comments
occurs via TF-IDF. Thus far clustering and dimension reduction have been most successful at three
clusters when subjectivity is not considered.<br>Stock prices are collected at the close through Yahoo
web-reader. Log returns are generated locally using Python. Linear regression with polynomial features
and associated metrics are generated with the Scikit-learn library functionality. R-squared has been
chosen as the baseline metric, given its wide use by both qualitative and quantitative styled
managers. Regression metrics for a given company/benchmark pair are offered as a baseline, all-sentiment
and clustered-sentiment metrics in a rolling time-series format.<br><br>If you are interested in reading
